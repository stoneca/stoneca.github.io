       <h1> When the late House Speaker Tomas P. “Tip” O’Neill (D) once declared that “all politics is local,” he wasn’t referring to gubernatorial candidates’ sources of campaign financing. When local political issues become national news headlines – think North Carolina’s HB2 – even the candidates in a relatively nominal state gubernatorial election can find themselves thrust into the spotlight and forced to appeal to a seemingly ever-expanding figurative electorate of voters across the country. 

In the race to governor’s office in North Carolina on Nov. 8, Republican incumbent Gov. Pat McCrory and Democratic opponent Attorney General Roy Cooper have found themselves squarely in the middle of such an ideological debate, and third quarter campaign finance data maintained by the State Board of Elections shows that individuals throughout the country are showing their support for either candidate through out-of-state campaign contributions.

The third quarter campaign finance data, which reports contributions made during the period between July 1 and Oct. 22, 2016, provides insight into how much money candidates are raising and where that money comes from. While political parties may give unlimited contributions to candidates, donations by individuals, single candidates committees and PACs are capped at $5,100 for statewide candidates. 

So how do the candidates’ third quarter campaign donations stack up? Released on Oct. 31, the reports show that Cooper’s campaign has raised over $8.85 million in donations since July 1, topping the McCrory campaign’s $5.17 million in donations during the same period by more than $3 million. Cooper also garnered more than twice the amount of individual campaign contributions during the same period, raking in over 23,000 separate contributions compared to just over 11,000 collected by the McCrory campaign.

In the final stretch of the race to the governor’s office, campaign finance data shows that both candidates have continued to receive an impressive amount of financial support from individual and group donors outside North Carolina.    

About 8.5 percent of the money reported in Cooper’s third quarter campaign contributions came from donors outside the state, totaling just over $750,000 in donations. McCrory also received a fair amount of out-of-state donations, with approximately 11.5 percent of his third quarter campaign contributions coming from donors outside the state of North Carolina and totaling just over $604,000. Both candidates reported donors from outside the United States as well, with each campaign garnering several hundred dollars in donations from residents of New Zealand, England, and Puerto Rico.  

Both candidates garnered donations from more than 40 different states and the District of Columbia, with significant contributions flowing in from states like New York, California, Texas, Florida and Virginia. Cooper’s campaign received more than $360,000 from donors in New York, California and Washington, D.C., which have consistently been top out-of-state financers for the Cooper campaign during this election cycle according to previous quarterly data. McCrory received nearly $110,000 in donations from Florida alone during the third quarter, with residents from Georgia and Michigan supplying upwards of an additional $120,000 to round out the Governor’s top three contributing states.
While many donors are moved to financially contribute to the campaigns a variety of candidates that align with their personal interests and beliefs, other out-of-state donors have ties to North Carolina and still feel compelled to contribute to the campaign of their gubernatorial candidate of choice although not currently living in the state. 

Stanford University graduate student, Alex Chin, expressed similar sentiments while describing his reasons for donating to Cooper’s campaign, saying, “I have very strong ties to the state, having grown up in North Carolina and attended both high school and undergrad in North Carolina, before moving to California for graduate school.” Chin said he is still a registered voter in North Carolina, which has also motivated him to donate to N.C. Senate candidate Deborah Ross (D), in addition to donating to Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

While both candidates’ out-of-state contribution figures are impressive, the third quarter campaign finance reports show that a vast majority of the campaign contributions reported by the gubernatorial candidates is still raised from individual donors in North Carolina. 

McCrory’s campaign raised over $4.5 million from North Carolina-based donors, who contributed just over 88 percent of the money raised by the Governor’s campaign in the third quarter. For Cooper’s campaign, North Carolinians donated more than $8 million, or approximately 91 percent, of the total reported campaign contributions in the third quarter.<h1>
